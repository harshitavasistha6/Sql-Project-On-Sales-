# Sql-Project-On-Sales-
Here are the key points about the SQL code in this project on sales analysis:

1. It creates 3 tables - salestable to store sales transactions, product to store product details, and customer_table to store customer details.

2. It inserts sample data into these tables.

3. It has several SQL queries to analyze the sales data:

- Total sales revenue per year 
- Average monthly sales for 2022
- Top 5 customers by total sales revenue
- Total sales amount and number of sales per month
- Product with highest sales 
- Top 5 customers with highest total sales
- Total sales amount and number of sales per category
- Top customers and products by revenue and total sales
- 50% of records using SQL limit
- LIKE queries to search by pattern 
- Second highest sale amount 
- Total sales and revenue per product 
- Joining the tables 
- Cumulative sum of sales over order
- Replacing part of a string
- Ranking functions to find 2nd, 3rd highest sales etc.

So in summary, it demonstrates CRUD operations, aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, DATE functions, JOINs, LIKE, string operations, window functions etc to analyze the sales data.
